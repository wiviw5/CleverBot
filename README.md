# CleverBot

A rewrite of my previous bot [reuploads](https://github.com/wiviw5/reuploads-discord.py) with better techniques & practices, along with a more fitting name.

This bot is made for practically only myself, but feel free to reuse the code as you see fit, I've hopefully made it easier for you to take what you want/need.

Now the bot has easy ways to implement new commands with the cogs & extensions system, making it basically plug and play.

TODO:
Implement downloading gifs with https://developers.google.com/tenor/guides/quickstart / https://tenor.com/gifapi/documentation so downloading gifs isn't so terrible.
